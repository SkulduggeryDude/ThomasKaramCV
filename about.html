					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<br>
					<p>I am a 25 year old male from Hamilton. I am currently studying at Wintec, undertaking a Bachelor of Applied Information Technology. I hope to start a career in IT, specialising in cybersecurity or network engineering. After leaving a previous degree in 2019 I took time off study to work and wait out the covid pandemic. During that time, I went solo travelling in Japan, moved out of home, vaccinated 12,000 members of the community, became a Buddhist monk, and discovered new things about myself. Now I am ready to start studying again and build my life to succeed. I have a passion for technology, I am a natural problem solver and have a fascination of how things work. These skills have given me the confidence and drive to succeed in study and work. I currently live in Hamilton with three fun flatmates, a happy axolotl, and a yellow breaded dragon.</p>

					<h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
					<br>
					<p>I am an avid gamer, spending most of my time in discord talking with my friends and playing games together. I usually play League of Legends and Overwatch, with a wide variety of games in rotation. I love to cook, having picked up many skills from my years working in kitchens. My favourite dish to make is Thai green curry. My flat has a large tea collection with about thirty different teas to choose from, my personal favourite being lemon and ginger. After my trip to Japan in 2019, I developed an interest in learning Japanese and now know basic characters, words, and phrases. 私を雇ってください. I am enthusiastic about the environment and taking care of people. My favourite genre of music is hip-hop, especially Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and Lil Nas X. </p>
